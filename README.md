## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone this repository
2. Navigate to the specific pattern or data structure you want to study
3. Read the README for that topic
4. Use the provided templates to solve problems
5. Practice with the example problems

## 📖 How to Use This Repository

### For Learning
- Start with data structures to understand the building blocks
- Move to algorithm patterns to learn problem-solving approaches
- Use the templates as starting points for your solutions

### For Practice
- Each pattern includes a template with common variations
- Data structures include basic operations and common use cases
- Utilities provide helper functions for common operations

## 🎯 Problem-Solving Approach

1. **Understand the Problem**: Read carefully and identify the core requirements
2. **Choose the Right Pattern**: Match the problem to an appropriate algorithm pattern
3. **Select Data Structures**: Pick the most efficient data structures for your solution
4. **Implement**: Use the templates as starting points
5. **Test**: Verify your solution with edge cases
6. **Optimize**: Analyze time and space complexity

## 📊 Complexity Reference
