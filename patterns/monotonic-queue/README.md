# Monotonic Queue

### üìñ When to Use
For problems involving sliding window maximum/minimum, maintaining order in a queue, or finding next/previous greater/smaller elements in a sequence.

### ‚è± Complexity
- Time: O(N) - each element is pushed and popped at most once
- Space: O(K) - where K is the window size
