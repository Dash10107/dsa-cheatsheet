# Divide and Conquer

## Description

Divide and conquer is a fundamental algorithmic paradigm that breaks a problem into smaller subproblems, solves each recursively, and combines their results. It is the basis for many efficient algorithms, especially for sorting, searching, and optimization.

### Key Steps
1. **Divide**: Split the problem into smaller subproblems.
2. **Conquer**: Solve each subproblem recursively.
3. **Combine**: Merge the solutions to subproblems into a final answer.

## Common Use Cases
- Sorting (Merge Sort, Quick Sort)
- Maximum Subarray Sum
- Closest Pair of Points
- Counting Inversions
- Karatsuba Multiplication
- Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)
- Matrix Multiplication (Strassen's)

## Tips
- Recursion is at the heart of divide and conquer.
- Base cases are crucial for correctness.
- Combining step can often be the trickiest part (e.g., merging in merge sort).
- Many problems can be optimized by switching to iterative or hybrid approaches for small subproblems.
