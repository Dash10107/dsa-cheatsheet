# Sliding Window

The sliding window technique is an algorithmic approach for efficiently solving problems that involve a contiguous subarray or substring. The core idea is to maintain a "window" of elements that slides over the data structure, reducing the need for nested loops and often lowering the time complexity from O(nÂ²) to O(n).

### ðŸ¤” How it Works

The technique uses two pointers, often called `start` and `end`, to define the current window. The window slides through the data, and at each step, the algorithm performs calculations on the elements within that window.

There are two main variations:

*   **Fixed-size window:** The window size remains constant throughout the process.
*   **Variable-size window:** The window size can grow or shrink based on certain conditions of the problem.
