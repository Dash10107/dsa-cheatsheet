# Divide and Conquer

Divide and conquer is a fundamental algorithmic paradigm that breaks a problem into smaller subproblems, solves each recursively, and combines their results. It is the basis for many efficient algorithms, especially for sorting, searching, and optimization.

### Key Steps
1. **Divide**: Split the problem into smaller subproblems.
2. **Conquer**: Solve each subproblem recursively.
3. **Combine**: Merge the solutions to subproblems into a final answer.

### Advantages
*   **Efficiency:** These algorithms are often very efficient, with time complexities like O(n log n).
*   **Solving Difficult Problems:** It simplifies complex problems by breaking them into smaller, more solvable parts.
*   **Parallelism:** The independent nature of the sub-problems makes this approach well-suited for parallel processing.
*   **Cache Efficiency:** They often have good cache performance.

### Disadvantages
*   **Recursion Overhead:** The recursive nature can lead to high memory usage due to stack overhead.
*   **Implementation Complexity:** Can be more complex to implement than iterative solutions.
*   **Not Always Suitable:** Not ideal for problems that cannot be easily divided into independent sub-problems.

## Tips
- Recursion is at the heart of divide and conquer.
- Base cases are crucial for correctness.
- Combining step can often be the trickiest part (e.g., merging in merge sort).
- Many problems can be optimized by switching to iterative or hybrid approaches for small subproblems.
