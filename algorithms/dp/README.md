# Dynamic Programming (DP)

Dynamic programming (DP) is an algorithmic paradigm for solving complex problems by breaking them down into a collection of simpler, overlapping subproblems. The core idea is to solve each subproblem only once and store its result, avoiding redundant computations.

### ‚≠ê Key Characteristics

1.  **Optimal Substructure:** A problem has optimal substructure if the optimal solution to the overall problem can be constructed from the optimal solutions of its subproblems.
2.  **Overlapping Subproblems:** This property means that a recursive algorithm for the problem solves the same subproblems multiple times. DP stores the solutions to these subproblems to be reused.

### üöÄ Approaches

1.  **Memoization (Top-Down):** This is a recursive approach. You write a standard recursive function, but before computing a result, you check if the solution for the specific subproblem has already been calculated and stored in a lookup table.
2.  **Tabulation (Bottom-Up):** This is an iterative approach. It solves the problem by starting from the smallest possible subproblems and building up to the final solution. The results are stored in a table (typically an array).

### üìñ Common Applications
*   Shortest path algorithms in a graph (e.g., Bellman-Ford, Floyd-Warshall).
*   The Knapsack problem.
*   Sequence alignment in bioinformatics.
*   Matrix chain multiplication.
*   Coin change problems.
