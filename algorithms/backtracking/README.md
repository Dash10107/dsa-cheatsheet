# Backtracking

Backtracking is a problem-solving algorithm that finds solutions by incrementally building a candidate solution and abandoning it as soon as it determines that the candidate cannot possibly be completed to a valid solution. It uses a brute-force, exhaustive search approach by trying all possible solutions to find the desired output.

### ü§î How it Works

The backtracking algorithm can be visualized as a depth-first search (DFS) of a state-space tree, which represents all possible states of a problem. The process generally follows these steps:

1.  **Start** at the root of the tree.
2.  **Explore** a path by making a choice.
3.  **Check** if the current choice leads to a valid solution.
    *   If it does, you have found a solution.
    *   If it's not a solution but is still viable, continue to the next level.
    *   If the choice leads to a "dead end" or violates a constraint, "backtrack" to the previous decision point.
4.  **Repeat** the process by trying a new, unexplored choice.
5.  The algorithm **ends** when all paths have been explored.

A key feature of backtracking is **pruning**. By abandoning paths that violate constraints, the algorithm can avoid exploring large portions of the state-space tree, making it more efficient than a simple brute-force search.

### üìñ When to Use
For generating all possible solutions and constraint satisfaction problems. Common examples include:

*   **Puzzles:** Such as Sudoku, N-Queens Problem, and crossword puzzles.
*   **Pathfinding:** Finding a path in a maze.
*   **Combinatorial Problems:** Generating all possible permutations, combinations, or subsets of a set.
*   **Scheduling and Resource Allocation:** Solving problems where specific constraints must be met.

### ‚è± Complexity
- Time: O(b^d) where b is branching factor, d is depth
- Space: O(d)
